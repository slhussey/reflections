What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
The hidden directory .git is created and basic meta-data is created.  This will allow git to be used to track changes in the files in the directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Working directory is where you make the edits.  Staging is just a list of files that make a logical unit and will be committed together.  The repository is the committed changes.  Allows for multiple logical groups of files.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Use git diff and git diff --staging to check what changes have been made and determine if they are logically related.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
When making changes that may not ever become part of the main or master branch

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
Shows the linear relationship of the various commits so that you know which changes (features) are in each version.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
The features/changes of both branches become available in a single version.  The original 2 branches are no longer needed as the new branch is the master.
